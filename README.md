# Summary

I cleaned housing data with the R language.

Data gathering often output data in a format that is not ready to apply data mining on it. There can be missing values, data points considered as outliers, non-formatted ones, etc. It is important to preprocess this data to make it ready for analysis. This project is using the R language to fix "dirty" data with techniques as imputation and deletion of outliers.
